All footage was shot on a phantom 4. Despite it's small size and smaller camera in comparison to our much large Inspire 2, it is still an impressively capable drone in it's own right. Even though we have a "better" bird, it really can't be replaced. As we've flown more and more with the I2, our skill has improved considerably since these shots were taken, and everything we have learned does still translate back to the smaller phantom. &nbsp;The phantom will always have a place in our toolkit. It's small size and wide angle lens can actually be large benefit on certain jobs. Although the flexibility of being able to use different lenses on the I2 is definitely a strong point for us, that doesn't mean it works for every occasion.</p>
