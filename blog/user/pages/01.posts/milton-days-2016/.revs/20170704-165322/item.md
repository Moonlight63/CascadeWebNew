Not only was it one of our first jobs after deciding to start drone photography professionally, but it was also the longest and hardest we had ever pushed our, at the time, only drone, the Phantom 4. We ended up flying for over 2 hours straight, making each battery last as long as we could. We even had the first battery recharged and ready for another flight by the time the last one had been used up. Since then, we've had jobs that lasted longer, but this one was very memorable for us.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
